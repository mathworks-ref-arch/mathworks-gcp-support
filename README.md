# MATLAB Interfaces *for Google Cloud Platform™ (GCP)*
A top level repository for MATLAB based interfaces for Google cloud platform services such as Google Cloud Storage™ and Google BigQuery™.

## System Requirements:
MathWorks Products (https://www.mathworks.com)

1. [MATLAB®](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
2. [MATLAB Compiler™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler.html) and [MATLAB Compiler SDK™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-compiler-sdk.html)
3. [MATLAB Production Server™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-production-server.html)
4. [MATLAB Parallel Server™](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-parallel-server.html)

Google Cloud Products (https://cloud.google.com/products)
1. Google Cloud account
2. GCP SDK for Java

Please note that some of the components included in this repository may require
different versions that supercede these requirements.

## Getting Started
Clone this repository using the recursive flag.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mathworks-ref-arch/mathworks-gcp-support.git
```

This is what your top level directory<sup>1</sup> should look like:

### Build the Java components

The MATLAB code uses a single Java SDK for all MATLAB interfaces for Google cloud which can be built using:
```bash
cd mathworks-gcp-support/matlab-gcp-common/Software/Java
mvn clean package
```

Please refer to the [Documentation](Documentation/README.md) to get started.
